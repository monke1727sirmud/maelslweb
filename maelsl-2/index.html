        <p>Hi, Welcome to my Personal website. 
            I'm Mael, you probably Know me from Second Life, OSGrid or even Dreamnation.
        Well here I am rebuilding my website and coding another page. It's been so difficult 
    to find the proper software to do it with since my current html coding software does not 
work with my new computer and won't be working with it for a very long time. Adobe needs some 
things to be fixed first before they actually launch it full blast onto MacOS M1 (ARM). 
Thanks everyone for stopping by my website and hope you have a great Day/night, which ever 
it is where you currently are.</p>
